# [Test everything](@id test_all)

This test runs most of the other tests in this module.
The defaults should be fine for most packages.
If you have a package that needs to customize the test, you can do so by providing appropriate keyword arguments to `Aqua.test_all()` (see below)

```@docs
Aqua.test_all
