One consequence is that a package that launches Tasks in its __init__ function may precompile successfully, but block precompilation of any packages that depend on it.\n\nExample\n\nLet's create a dummy package, PkgA, that launches a persistent Task:\n\nmodule PkgA\nconst t = Ref{Any}()   # to prevent the Timer from being garbage-collected\n__init__() = t[] = Timer(0.1; interval=1)   # create a persistent `Timer` `Task`\nend\n\nPkgA will precompile successfully, because PkgA.__init__() does not run when PkgA is precompiled. However,\n\nmodule PkgB\nusing PkgA\nend\n\nfails to precompile: using PkgA runs PkgA.__init__(), which leaves the Timer Task running, and that causes precompilation of PkgB to hang.\n\nHow the test works\n\nThis test works by launching a Julia process that tries to precompile a dummy package similar to PkgB above, modified to signal back to Aqua when PkgA has finished loading. The test fails if the gap between loading PkgA and finishing precompilation exceeds time tmax.\n\nHow to fix failing packages\n\nOften, the easiest fix is to modify the __init__ function to check whether the Julia process is precompiling some other package; if so, don't launch the persistent Tasks.\n\nfunction __init__()\n    # Other setup code here\n    if ccall(:jl_generating_output, Cint, ()) == 0   # if we're not precompiling...\n        # launch persistent tasks here\n    end\nend\n\nIn more complex cases, you may need to set up independently-callable functions to launch the tasks and set conditions that allow them to cleanly exit.\n\nArguments\n\npackage: a top-level Module or Base.PkgId.\n\nKeyword Arguments\n\nbroken::Bool = false: If true, it uses @test_broken instead of @test.\ntmax::Real = 5: the maximum time (in seconds) to wait after loading the package before forcibly shutting down the precompilation process (triggering a test failure).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#Aqua.test_piracy-Tuple{Module}","page":"Home","title":"Aqua.test_piracy","text":"test_piracy(m::Module)\n\nTest that m does not commit type piracy.

Note that this does not imply that package loads the dependencies directly, this can be achieved via transitivity as well.\n\nnote: Weak dependencies and extensions\nDue to the automatic loading of package extensions once all of their trigger dependencies are loaded, Aqua.jl can, by design of julia, not check if a package extension indeed loads all of its trigger dependencies using import or using. \n\nwarning: Known bug\nCurrently, Aqua.test_stale_deps does not detect stale dependencies when they are stdlib.
